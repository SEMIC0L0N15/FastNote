# FastNote
## About the project
FastNote is an application which was primary designed to manage your notes - and to do it fast. As the project go further, there will be implemented variety of solutions for automatic note management, like tags generation or auto-sorting algorithm. Also the user interface will be extended, so the user will be able to drag-and-drop almost everything to almost everywhere (a basic drag-and-drop system has been already implemented and prepared to reuse).

Supported platforms:
- Windows

Currently, the project is being suspended, but it could get resumed at any time.
